    <h1>Software Security 2020/2021</h1>

    <p> This course unit introduces students to basic and advanced approaches to formally build verified trustworthy software systems, where trustworthy comprise five attributes: reliability, availability, safety, resilience and security.</p>

    <p>This course will be taught by <a href="https://ssvlab.github.io/lucasccordeiro/">Lucas Cordeiro</a> for post-graduate students in Computer Science. This page contains information about the course.</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>

      <p>
      Software is subjected to numerous forms of attack such as memory corruption, buffer overflows and injection; these flaws are often too complex or expressive to be manually detected by the software developer.
     </p>

    <p>
    Tools and techniques are used in order to prevent and detect software flaws, which are too complex to be manually found, e.g., modelling, code reviews, funzzing, static and dynamic code analyses, program verification and code tainting.
    </p>

    <h2>Relationship to Other Courses</h2>

    <p>
    Software Security involves people and practices, to build software systems to ensure confidentiality, integrity and availability. Therefore, this course has connections to other disciplines: cyber-Security, cryptography, automated reasoning and verification, logic and modelling, agile and test-driven development, software engineering concepts and systems governance.

    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
    <p>Basic programming skills, incl. familiarity with C and Python 3
      In more detail:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        For C, you should at least know how pointers and dynamic memories work.
      </li>
      <li>
        For Python, you should know how to do basic algorithms and interact with the host system.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Basic notions in Linux sysadmin:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Create a web server.
      </li>
      <li>
        Understand the difference between user space and kernel space.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>

    <ul>
      <li> Define <b>standard notions of security</b> and use
        them to evaluate the <b>system's confidentiality, integrity</b>
        and <b>availability</b>

      <li> Explain standard <b>softwre security problems</b> in real-world applications </li>

      <li> Use <b>testing and verification</b> techniques to reason about the <b>system's safety</b> and
        <b>security</b> </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Grading</h2>

    <p>To be defined</p>
