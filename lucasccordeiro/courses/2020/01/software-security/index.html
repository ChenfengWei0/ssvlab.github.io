    <h1>Software Security 2020/2021</h1>

    <p><a href="https://ssvlab.github.io/lucasccordeiro/">Lucas Cordeiro</a> will teach this course for post-graduate students in Computer Science. This page contains information about the course.</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>

      <p>
      Software is subjected to numerous forms of attack such as memory corruption, buffer overflows and injection; these flaws are often too complex or expressive to be manually detected by the software developer. Tools and techniques are used in order to prevent and detect software flaws, which are too hard to be manually found, e.g., modelling, code reviews, fuzzing, static and dynamic code analyses, program verification and code tainting.
    </p>

    <p> This course unit introduces students to basic and advanced approaches to formally build verified trustworthy software systems, where trustworthy comprise five attributes: reliability, availability, safety, resilience and security.</p>

    <h2>Relationship to other courses</h2>

    <p>
    Software Security involves people and practices, to build software systems to ensure confidentiality, integrity and availability. Therefore, this course has connections to other disciplines: cyber-security, cryptography, automated reasoning and verification, logic and modelling, agile and test-driven development, software engineering concepts and systems governance.
    </p>

    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
    <p>Fundamental programming skills, including familiarity with C and Python 3. In more detail:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        For C, the student should at least know how pointers and dynamic memories work.
      </li>
      <li>
        For Python, the student should know how to develop basic algorithms/data structures and interact with the host system.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Basic notions in Linux System Administration:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Create a web server.
      </li>
      <li>
        Understand the difference between user space and kernel space.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs)</h2>

    <p> On successful completion of this course unit, a student will be able to <p>
    <ul>
      <li> <b>Explain computer security problem</b> and why broken software lies at its heart.
      <li> <b>Explain</b> continuous <b>risk management</b> and how to put it into practice to ensure software security.
      <li> <b>Introduce security properties</b> into the software <b>development lifecycle</b>.
      <li> <b>Use software validation and verification techniques</b> to detect software vulnerabilities and mitigate against them.
      <li> <b>Relate security testing and verification to risk analysis</b> to address continued resilience when a cyber-attack takes place.
      <li> <b>Develop case studies</b> to think as an attacker and mitigate them using software verification and testing.
